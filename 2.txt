. Implied Volatility (IV) Rank
Agent Affected: Agent_IV_Rank

Missing Data: You fetch the Options Chain (list of contracts), but you do not calculate or fetch the historical IV rank.

Why it matters: You cannot know if options are "expensive" or "cheap" without this.

Fix: Need a store of 30-day IV history to calculate "Rank" (Current IV vs 30-day High/Low).

2. Net Gamma Exposure (GEX)
Agent Affected: Agent_Greeks_Monitor / Agent_Options_Chain

Missing Data: You are fetching generic Greeks from the ticker. You need the Open Interest per Strike combined with the Gamma per Strike to calculate the "Gamma Flip" level (where market makers stop suppressing volatility).

Fix: Logic to iterate through the Options Chain, multiply OI * Gamma for every strike, and sum them up.

3. Put/Call Ratio (Volume & OI)
Agent Affected: Agent_Put_Call_Ratio

Missing Data: You have the options chain, but you aren't summing up the Total Put Volume vs. Total Call Volume.

Fix: A loop in data_ingestion.py that aggregates volume from the fetched options chain: Total_Put_Vol / Total_Call_Vol.

4. True Social Volume (Reddit/Twitter)
Agent Affected: Agent_Social_Hype

Missing Data: Currently, this agent relies on the "Fear & Greed Index" (which is a lagging composite). It does not have raw social volume (mentions per hour).

Fix: Real Twitter/X API access (expensive) or a proxy service like LunarCrush (requires API key). "Fear & Greed" is a weak substitute for "Hype".

5. Liquidation Map (Heatmap)
Agent Affected: Agent_Liquidations

Missing Data: You are listening to real-time liquidations (websocket), which is good. But you lack the predictive "Liquidation Heatmap" (where leverage will be liquidated).

Fix: This is hard to get for free. Most institutional bots pay for Kingfisher or Coinglass API. Your current setup reacts to liquidations after they happen, rather than targeting the levels before.
