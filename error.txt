The Coinalyze API provides access to liquidation data through the get/liquidation-history endpoint, which retrieves historical liquidation data for specified futures markets.
 This endpoint requires the symbols parameter, which is a comma-separated list of market symbols (e.g., BTCUSDT_PERP.A), and supports a maximum of 20 symbols per request.
 Additional query parameters include interval (e.g., "1min", "1hour", "daily"), from, and to, which define the time range in UNIX timestamps.
 The convert_to_usd parameter can be set to "true" to convert values to USD.

The API returns data in JSON format, with each symbol having a history array containing objects with t (timestamp), o (open), h (high), l (low), and c (close) values representing the liquidation data.
 The data is returned in ascending order, and historical data is retained for up to 1500–2000 data points for intraday intervals, with older data being deleted daily.
 For daily intervals, data is not deleted.

Coinalyze aggregates liquidation data by combining coin-margined and stablecoin-margined contract liquidations, converting them to USD for consistency.
 The platform supports multiple exchanges, including Binance, Bybit, OKX, and Kraken, with specific contracts like API3USDT, API3-USDT-SWAP, and pf_api3usd being included in the data.
 As of February 2025, ByBit resumed providing full liquidation data after a period of limited reporting.

Authentication is handled via an API key provided in the header or as a query parameter.
 The rate limit is 40 API calls per minute per key, and exceeding this limit results in a 429 HTTP response with a Retry-After header indicating the wait time.
 The API is free to use, and users are encouraged to cite the data source when used publicly.
